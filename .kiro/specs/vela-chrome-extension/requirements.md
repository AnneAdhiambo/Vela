# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Vela is a Chrome extension that replaces the default new tab page with a productivity-focused dashboard. The extension combines timer-based focus sessions (Pomodoro technique), task management, progress tracking, and motivational elements to help users maintain productive workflows. The core value proposition is transforming every new tab into a productivity opportunity with a clean, minimalist interface that loads instantly and works offline.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: New Tab Override and Core Infrastructure

2. WHEN the Vela dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL complete initial rendering in under 200ms
3. WHEN the extension is disabled THEN the system SHALL gracefully fallback to the default Chrome new tab behavior
4. WHEN a user navigates using browser back/forward buttons THEN the system SHALL preserve normal browser navigation functionality
5. IF the extension fails to load THEN the system SHALL display a minimal error state with retry option

9. WHEN the timer shows a streak THEN the system SHALL display a water droplet icon as a streak fire badge
